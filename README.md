## About
MeetUp application created by create-react-app, utilizing the MeetUp API and AWS Lambda. I'm planning to give it some styling soon. For now, the hosted project can be viewed [here](https://lillapulay.github.io/meetup/). The app visualizes the number of events coming up in the next 7 days and shows a list of all events in a certain location. Further details are available by clicking the "Details" button. 
This project was part of the CF Full-Stack Web Development course. 


### Planned updates:
- [ ] Styling (e.g. background image)
- [ ] Pie chart placement
